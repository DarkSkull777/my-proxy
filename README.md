# My Proxy - Fast and Easy Proxy Testing and Scraping

Welcome to the **My Proxy**! This repository contains two powerful scripts to help you with your proxy needs: a Proxy Checker and a Proxy Scraper. Whether you're testing proxies for reliability or scraping fresh proxies from the web, these tools have got you covered.

## Contents

1. **Proxy Checker**: Test if your proxies are working or not.
2. **Proxy Scraper**: Scrape and save fresh proxies from various sources.

## Requirements

Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3
- `requests` library
- `argparse` library
- `termcolor` library
- `flake8` library
- `pep8-naming` library

You can install the required libraries with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 1. Proxy Checker

The **Proxy Checker** is designed to quickly and easily test proxies to see if they‚Äôre working. You can test proxies from a list, check a single proxy, and even choose to save the working ones.

### Usage

```bash
python proxychecker.py [-h] [-l LIST] [-o OUTPUT] [-t TARGET] [-a]
```

### Options

- `-l` or `--list`: Specifies the file with the list of proxies to be tested.
- `-o` or `--output`: Saves the working proxies to the specified file.
- `-t` or `--target`: Tests a single proxy (e.g., `-t 127.0.0.1:8008`).
- `-a` or `--all`: Show all statuses (both working and not working proxies).
- `-h` or `--help`: Show the help message and exit.

### Examples

#### Mass Proxy Testing

To test a list of proxies from a file and save the working ones:

```bash
python proxychecker.py -l proxy.txt -o working_proxies.txt
```

#### Single Proxy Testing

To test a single proxy:

```bash
python proxychecker.py -t 127.0.0.1:8008
```

#### Display All Results

If you want to see all the results, not just the working ones:

```bash
python proxychecker.py -l proxy.txt -a
```

### Example Output

When you run the Proxy Checker, the output in your terminal will look like this:

```bash
127.0.0.1:8008 -> Working
192.168.0.1:8080 -> Not Working
```

## 2. Proxy Scraper

The **Proxy Scraper** allows you to scrape fresh proxies from the web, based on the type of proxy you need (HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, SOCKS5). You can save the results to a file and even increase verbosity to see more details during scraping.

### Usage

```bash
python proxyscraper.py [-h] -p PROXY [-o OUTPUT] [-v]
```

### Options

- `-p` or `--proxy`: Specify the type of proxy you want to scrape (`http`, `https`, `socks4`, `socks5`).
- `-o` or `--output`: Save the scraped proxies to the specified file.
- `-v` or `--verbose`: Increase output verbosity to see more details during scraping.
- `-h` or `--help`: Show the help message and exit.

### Examples

#### Scrape HTTP Proxies

To scrape HTTP proxies and save them to a file:

```bash
python proxyscraper.py -p http -o scraped_proxies.txt
```

#### Scrape SOCKS5 Proxies with Verbose Output

To scrape SOCKS5 proxies and see more detailed output:

```bash
python proxyscraper.py -p socks5 -v
```

## Conclusion

With **My Proxy**, you can easily manage your proxies, whether you're testing their reliability or scraping fresh ones. Enjoy proxy hunting and scraping! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
